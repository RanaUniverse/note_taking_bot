# This is my Python Note Making logic in Telegram Bot

This project will main intention to make and learn python backend logic to manage and use things.

```
Note taking application
- allows users to create acoount
- allows to create notes (for that specific user)
- allows editing of notes (only owner of the note)
- allows deleting the note (only owner)

It would be nice if it would allow markdown also
