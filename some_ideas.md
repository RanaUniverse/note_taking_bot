## Making New account:

The process of this, first it will start a conversation handler:


## /start :-

1. When user will send this bot will say a welcome message and say to use `/my_notes`, `/info`- showing the user status. 
/info :-Knows about your full informations 
/my_notes :-Shows All My Notes 
/search_my_notes :- Search My Notes in Title



## /help :-

1. It will show different commands and it work.
/activate_my_account :- Ask for some user informations step by step to save in the database.




## /register_me 

1. First it will try to add him in the databse. if it ok then ok
2. If it got failed it should check if this already in the database table or not,
3. I have added this successfully.




## /new_notes :-

This part is for making new note.
1. This will a conversation where it need title, content and confirmation to save thsi note.

2. Here i need to make some command related to this, `register`- when user is not register.

3. `/add_points` - i will make it to add some points which will need to make one note, this need to be make like it will need some things like balance topup to get to new point.


## A BIG ISSUE
I need to solve the problem wheere i past store the note title and content in formatting, but i found i need to have 2 more column or what i dont understnad uflly for now.



## /new_fake_note or /fake_note /generate_fake_note.

1. For this it will check about user's row is available or not.
2. it will use faker library and it will insert this.




## /add_points:-
1. This need to be a Admin wish to give the points to a user or not.
2. For now i make it as a demo




## My Ideas

Here i will keep writing some ideas i want to do with bot or related this project.



## 1st:

First thigns i will allow user to create a account or use his own telegram account as his own account.



## 2nd:

when it will ask user to make a new note it will use conversation handler to make first ask for `title`, `content`, `save this note or not`, 

After this note will save it will return the user the a unique things so that later this user want to see the note he can search the title or serach this unique no or a string i dont undestand. what i will do to make a note making app.
